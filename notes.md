version of About Me, from 13 Dec

After graduating from from Central St Martins with a fine art degree in painting I did some travelling which opened my mind. On my return, after a spell of unemployment, I retrained and discovered coding which opened the door to a new world of creativity. I discovered I could create things that were functional, useful and meaningful to people.

After the loss of a close friend I became interested in meditation and mindfulness, understanding these were powerful tools to deal with negative experiences and cultivate a peaceful mind. I worked as a designer / developer / manager at a meditation centre for 12 years, and taught meditation on a voluntary basis, which I still do to this day.

I am revisiting web development, now with my coding toolkit enriched by meditation and raring to get creative with coding again.

version 1

Writing code isn't just about completing tasks and projects but also about how people feel, communicate and connect. For me, the basic ingredient for succesful working relationships is a positive attitude and a peaceful heart. My main wish is to do what I love, do it well and see the good in people whilst staying positive, no matter how hard the situation may be.

I'm originally from a fine art background. After graduating I travelled, retrained and discovered coding. 
        Coding matched my fascination with how and why things work, or don't work - internally and externally. 
        I've always wanted to understand how the mind works and this led me to train in meditation which I still practice now. 
        I beleive the essential ingredient for succesful working relationships is a positive and peaceful mind. 
        Writing code isn't just about completing tasks and projects but its more about how people think, speak and work. 
        My intention is to do my job well whilst remembering how important people are. 

Version 2
I'm originally from a fine art background. After graduating I travelled, retrained and discovered coding. 
        Coding matched my fascination with how and why things work, or don't work - internally and externally. 
        For example, wanting to understand how the mind works led me to train in meditation which is all about developing inner peace.
