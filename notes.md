          I'm originally from a fine art background. After graduating I travelled, retrained and discovered coding. 
          Coding matched my fascination with how and why things work, or don't work - internally and externally. 
          For example, wanting to understand how the mind works led me to train in meditation which is all about developing inner peace. 
          <br><br>
          Writing code isn't just about completing tasks and projects but its more about how people think, speak and work. 
          I beleive the essential ingredient for succesful working relationships is a positive and peaceful mind. 
          My intention is to do my job well and keep a positive attitude towards others - no matter how challenging the situation may be.</p>

I'm originally from a fine art background. After graduating I travelled, retrained and discovered coding. 
        Coding matched my fascination with how and why things work, or don't work - internally and externally. 
        I've always wanted to understand how the mind works and this led me to train in meditation which I still practice now. 
        I beleive the essential ingredient for succesful working relationships is a positive and peaceful mind. 
        Writing code isn't just about completing tasks and projects but its more about how people think, speak and work. 
        My intention is to do my job well whilst remembering how important people are.
